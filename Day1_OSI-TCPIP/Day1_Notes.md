Day 1 â€“ OSI Model, TCP/IP & Wireshark Basics
ðŸ”¹ 1. OSI Model (7 Layers)

Application Layer â€“ User applications like HTTP, FTP, DNS.

Presentation Layer â€“ Encryption, compression, data formatting.

Session Layer â€“ Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions.

Transport Layer â€“ Ensures reliable delivery (TCP/UDP).

Network Layer â€“ Logical addressing (IP) and routing.

Data Link Layer â€“ MAC addressing and error detection.

Physical Layer â€“ Physical transmission: cables, signals, hardware.

ðŸ”¹ 2. TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)

Application Layer â€“ Protocols (HTTP, DNS, SMTP).

Transport Layer â€“ Responsible for end-to-end delivery (TCP/UDP).

Internet Layer â€“ IP addressing, routing.

Network Access Layer â€“ Ethernet, ARP, physical transmission.

ðŸ”¹ 3. TCP 3-Way Handshake

Step 1: SYN â†’ Client requests a connection.

Step 2: SYN/ACK â†’ Server acknowledges request.

Step 3: ACK â†’ Client confirms.
âœ… Secure TCP session established.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Practical Task (Wireshark)

Install and open Wireshark.

Start packet capture on your active network interface.

Open browser â†’ Visit http://example.com.

Stop capture.

Apply filter:

http


Look for TCP 3-way handshake (SYN â†’ SYN/ACK â†’ ACK) packets.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Key Takeaways

Understood OSI vs TCP/IP models.

Learned how TCP handshake establishes reliable communication.

Performed first hands-on task with Wireshark.
