Day 7 â€“ Threat Intelligence & IOC Hunting
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Threat Intelligence?

Threat Intelligence (TI) = Information about current & emerging cyber threats.

It helps SOC Analysts:

Detect attacks faster.

Block malicious IPs/domains.

Understand attacker Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

Types of Threat Intelligence:

Strategic â€“ High-level info for management (trends, risks).

Tactical â€“ Attack methods (phishing, malware families).

Operational â€“ Specific campaigns (APT groups, C2 servers).

Technical â€“ Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

ðŸ”¹ 2. What are IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)?

IOCs are pieces of forensic data that indicate malicious activity.

Examples:

IP Address â†’ 45.77.12.34 (known C2 server)

Domain Name â†’ evil-malware.com

File Hash (MD5/SHA256) â†’ Used to identify malware samples

Email Address â†’ attacker@example.com

Registry Keys / File Paths â†’ Persistence artifacts in Windows

ðŸ”¹ 3. IOC Sources (Free Threat Feeds)

AlienVault OTX

Abuse.ch

VirusTotal

CIRCL Feeds

ðŸ”¹ 4. IOC Hunting Workflow (SOC Analyst)

Collect IOC (from threat feeds, reports, SIEM alerts).

Search Logs (firewall, DNS, proxy, endpoint).

Correlate Events (check multiple IOCs in different logs).

Take Action â€“ Block IP/domain, quarantine file, escalate incident.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Practical Task
Task A: Check Malicious IP/Domain

Go to VirusTotal
.

Enter a sample malicious IP/domain (from threat feeds like Abuse.ch).

Observe detection report.

Task B: IOC Hunting in Logs (Linux)

Suppose IOC = Malicious IP 45.77.12.34.

Search in logs:

grep "45.77.12.34" /var/log/auth.log
grep "45.77.12.34" /var/log/syslog


If IOC appears â†’ alert triggered.

Task C: SIEM Query (Splunk Example)

Search for failed login attempts from IOC IP:

index=security sourcetype=linux_secure "45.77.12.34"
