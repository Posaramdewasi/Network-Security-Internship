Day 29 â€“ Case Study: Simulated Cyber Attack & Incident Handling
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is a Red vs Blue Exercise?

Red Team â†’ Acts as attacker (simulate phishing, brute force, malware).

Blue Team (SOC) â†’ Defends using SIEM, EDR, logs, incident response.

Goal â†’ Train SOC analysts to detect, analyze, and respond to real-world attacks.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Attack Simulation (Red Team)
Attack Scenario

Initial Access â†’ Attacker sends phishing email with malicious attachment.

Execution â†’ Victim opens attachment â†’ malware executed.

Persistence â†’ Malware creates registry key for startup.

Lateral Movement â†’ Attacker runs brute force on another system.

Exfiltration â†’ Attacker sends sensitive files to external server.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Defense (Blue Team SOC Tasks)
Detection in SIEM/EDR

Phishing Detection â†’ Suspicious email flagged in SIEM.

Process Execution â†’ Sysmon Event ID 1 (powershell.exe suspicious script).

Persistence â†’ Registry modification (Sysmon Event ID 13).

Brute Force Attempts â†’ Windows Event ID 4625 (multiple failed logins).

Data Exfiltration â†’ High outbound traffic detected in firewall logs.

Response Steps

Isolate infected machine.

Kill malicious process.

Block attacker IP/domain in firewall.

Reset compromised credentials.

Document entire attack in report.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Practical Tasks
Task A: Simulate Attack in Lab (Optional)

Use Kali Linux (Red Team) â†’ Send phishing email or run brute force with Hydra.

Use Windows VM (Victim) â†’ Open suspicious file.

Task B: Detect with SIEM

Query logs in Splunk/ELK:

index=security EventCode=4625 | stats count by src_ip, user


Create alert for brute force detection.

Task C: Incident Response Report
# Incident Response Report â€“ Red vs Blue Exercise

- **Date/Time**: 2025-09-10
- **Attack Vector**: Phishing â†’ Malware â†’ Persistence â†’ Brute Force â†’ Data Exfiltration
- **Detection**:
  - SIEM logs: Failed logins (4625), Suspicious PowerShell
  - Sysmon: Registry modification, process creation
- **Actions Taken**:
  1. Isolated infected endpoint
  2. Killed malware process
  3. Blocked attacker IP
  4. Reset compromised account
- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Improve phishing awareness training
  - Add IOC feeds to SIEM
  - Tune detection rules for persistence
