Day 16 â€“ Threat Intelligence Basics (MITRE ATT&CK, IOC Feeds, TI Platforms)
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Threat Intelligence (TI)?

Threat Intelligence (TI): Actionable knowledge about adversaries (attackers), their tools, techniques, and infrastructure.

Purpose:

Identify threats before they cause damage.

Improve detection rules in SIEM/IDS.

Support incident response & hunting.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Types of Threat Intelligence

Strategic TI â†’ Big-picture (Who is attacking? Why? Trends).

Tactical TI â†’ Adversary TTPs (Tools, Techniques, Procedures).

Operational TI â†’ Campaign-level info (Ongoing phishing/malware ops).

Technical TI â†’ Specific IOCs (Hashes, IPs, URLs, Domains).

ðŸ”¹ 3. MITRE ATT&CK Framework

ATT&CK = Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge.

A knowledge base of how attackers operate.

Categories (Tactics):

Initial Access

Execution

Persistence

Privilege Escalation

Defense Evasion

Credential Access

Discovery

Lateral Movement

Collection

Exfiltration

Command & Control (C2)

ðŸ“Œ Example:

T1566: Phishing â†’ Technique for Initial Access.

Detection Idea: Monitor suspicious emails with malicious attachments.

ðŸ”¹ 4. IOC (Indicators of Compromise)

File Hashes (MD5, SHA256) â†’ Malware samples.

Domains/IPs â†’ Command & Control servers.

URLs â†’ Phishing links.

Registry Keys/Processes â†’ Persistence mechanisms.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Threat Intel Sources (Free Feeds)

AlienVault OTX â†’ Open Threat Exchange.

Abuse.ch â†’ Malware & botnet trackers.

MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform).

VirusTotal â†’ Malware hash & file analysis.

CIRCL Feeds, ThreatFox.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Practical Tasks
Task A: Explore MITRE ATT&CK

Go to https://attack.mitre.org
.

Explore tactics & techniques.

Take screenshot of one technique page (e.g., T1566 â€“ Phishing).


Task B: Collect IOC from Malware Sample

Use sha256sum on sample file.

Search the hash on VirusTotal
.

Extract related domains & IPs.


Task C: Use Threat Intel Feed (AlienVault OTX)

Register free at https://otx.alienvault.com
.

Search for a recent malware campaign.

Export IOCs (IPs, domains, hashes).


Task D: Create IOC File (CSV/MD)

Example (CSV format):

Type,Value,Description
IP,45.77.23.11,C2 Server
Domain,malicious-site.com,Phishing
SHA256,abcd1234...,Ransomware sample
