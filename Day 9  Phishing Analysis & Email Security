Day 9 – Phishing Analysis & Email Security
🔹 1. What is Phishing?

Phishing = Social engineering attack where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive data (passwords, banking info, etc.).

Common methods:

Email phishing – Fake emails pretending to be legit.

Spear phishing – Targeted attacks against specific individuals.

Whaling – Attacks targeting executives (CEO fraud).

Smishing & Vishing – Phishing via SMS & phone calls.

🔹 2. Common Signs of a Phishing Email

Suspicious sender email (e.g., support@micros0ft.com
).

Urgent language (“Your account will be suspended!”).

Malicious links (hover → doesn’t match text).

Attachments with macros (e.g., invoice.docm).

Poor grammar, spelling errors.

🔹 3. Email Security Fundamentals

SPF (Sender Policy Framework) – Prevents spoofing.

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) – Ensures message integrity.

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) – Prevents domain impersonation.

🔹 4. Tools for Phishing Analysis

Email Header Analysis → Check “Received from”, SPF/DKIM.

URL Analysis →

VirusTotal

PhishTank

urlscan.io

Attachment Analysis →

Hybrid Analysis

Any.Run Sandbox

Decoding URLs → base64, hex encoded payloads.

🔹 5. Practical Task
Task A: Analyze an Email Header

Copy email header from Gmail/Outlook.

Use tool: MxToolbox Header Analyzer
.

Identify:

Real sender IP.

SPF/DKIM/DMARC results.

Task B: Analyze a Suspicious URL

Take a phishing sample URL (from PhishTank
).

Submit to VirusTotal / urlscan.io.

Check if flagged as malicious.

Task C: Analyze a Suspicious Attachment

Download safe test sample from MalwareBazaar
 or use EICAR file.

Upload to Hybrid Analysis.

Check execution behavior (C2 connections, registry changes).

🔹 6. SOC Analyst Workflow for Phishing Investigation

User reports suspicious email.

Check email headers → Verify SPF/DKIM.

Analyze URL/Attachment in sandbox.

Search SIEM logs for other users receiving similar emails.

Block domain/IP in firewall/proxy.

Educate user to avoid clicking such links.
