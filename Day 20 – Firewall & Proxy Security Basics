Day 20 â€“ Firewall & Proxy Security Basics
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is a Firewall?

Firewall = Network security device that monitors and controls incoming/outgoing traffic.

Purpose:

Block unauthorized access

Allow legitimate traffic

Prevent attacks (DoS, malware, intrusions)

Types of Firewalls:

Network Firewall â†’ Protects entire network (hardware/software)

Host-based Firewall â†’ Protects individual endpoints (Windows Firewall, iptables)

Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) â†’ Deep packet inspection, application filtering

ðŸ”¹ 2. What is a Proxy Server?

Proxy Server = Intermediary between client and internet.

Purpose:

Monitor web traffic

Block malicious websites

Cache content for speed

Provide anonymity for users

ðŸ”¹ 3. Firewall Rules Basics
Rule	Description
Allow	Permit traffic (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS)
Deny / Block	Prevent traffic (e.g., Telnet, unknown IPs)
NAT	Network Address Translation for internal network
Port Forwarding	Map external port to internal service

Rule Order Matters â†’ First match is applied

ðŸ”¹ 4. Firewall Logging & Monitoring

Logs provide info on:

Blocked connections

Allowed traffic

Suspicious IPs/ports

SOC Analysts monitor firewall logs in SIEM to detect threats

ðŸ”¹ 5. Practical Tasks
Task A: Configure Windows Firewall

Open Windows Defender Firewall â†’ Advanced Settings

Create Inbound Rule â†’ Block TCP port 23 (Telnet)

Test by trying to connect via Telnet from another machine

Task B: Allow Only HTTP/HTTPS

Create Inbound Rule â†’ Allow TCP 80/443

Deny all other ports (except default system ports)

Test by accessing allowed and blocked services

Task C: Proxy Logging

Install Squid Proxy on Linux:

sudo apt install squid -y
sudo systemctl start squid
sudo systemctl enable squid


Configure browser to use proxy

Access websites â†’ Check log: /var/log/squid/access.log

Task D: Detect Malicious Traffic

Add ACL in Squid to block malicious domains (example.com)

acl blocked dstdomain example.com
http_access deny blocked


Test by visiting blocked site â†’ Should be denied
