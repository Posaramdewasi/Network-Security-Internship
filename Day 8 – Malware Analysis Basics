Day 8 â€“ Malware Analysis Basics (Static & Dynamic)
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Malware Analysis?

Malware Analysis = Process of studying a malicious file/program to understand:

What it does

How it spreads

How to detect & stop it

Two Main Types:

Static Analysis â†’ Analyze malware without executing it.

Dynamic Analysis â†’ Execute malware in a safe lab (sandbox/VM) to observe behavior.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Static Malware Analysis (No Execution)

You donâ€™t run the file, you just examine it.

Techniques:

Check File Hash:

md5sum sample.exe
sha256sum sample.exe


Check File Type:

file sample.exe
strings sample.exe | less


Check with VirusTotal:

Upload hash/file â†’ see AV detections.

Check PE Headers (Windows EXE):

Tools: PEiD, Detect It Easy (DIE).

Look for Suspicious Strings:

URLs, IPs, registry keys, function calls.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Dynamic Malware Analysis (Execution in Sandbox)

You run the file in a safe isolated environment (VM or Sandbox) to see its behavior.

Techniques:

Process Monitoring â†’ Sysinternals Process Monitor (procmon).

Network Monitoring â†’ Wireshark/tcpdump to see C2 connections.

Registry & File Changes â†’ Regshot, Autoruns.

Behavior Reports â†’ Tools like Cuckoo Sandbox, Any.Run.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Tools for Malware Analysis

Static: strings, file, VirusTotal, PEiD, Detect-It-Easy.

Dynamic: Procmon, Process Explorer, Wireshark, Regshot.

Online Sandboxes: Any.Run, Hybrid Analysis, Cuckoo Sandbox.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Practical Task
Task A: Static Analysis

Download a test file from EICAR (safe antivirus test file):

Link: https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/

Run:

file eicar.com
strings eicar.com | less
md5sum eicar.com


Upload hash/file to VirusTotal.

Task B: Dynamic Analysis (Safe in VM)

Run sample (EICAR or safe malware from Any.Run) inside isolated VM.

Monitor with:

Procmon â†’ New processes, file writes.

Wireshark â†’ Outgoing connections.

Regshot â†’ Registry changes.

Save report.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Best Practices for Malware Analysis

Always use isolated VM (no internet unless needed).

Take snapshots before analysis.

Never analyze malware on your host machine.

Use EICAR test file or sandboxes for safe practice.
