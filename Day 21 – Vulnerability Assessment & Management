Day 21 â€“ Vulnerability Assessment & Management
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Vulnerability Assessment (VA)?

Vulnerability Assessment = Process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications.

Purpose:

Detect weaknesses before attackers exploit them

Reduce risk and improve security posture

Aid in patch management

ðŸ”¹ 2. Vulnerability Management Lifecycle

Discovery: Identify all assets (servers, endpoints, network devices)

Assessment: Scan assets for vulnerabilities

Prioritization: Rank vulnerabilities by risk (CVSS score, business impact)

Remediation: Apply patches, configuration changes, or mitigations

Reporting & Monitoring: Track unresolved vulnerabilities

ðŸ”¹ 3. Popular Vulnerability Assessment Tools
Tool	Description
Nessus	Widely used commercial VA scanner; plugin-based detection
OpenVAS	Open-source alternative to Nessus; full vulnerability scanner
Nmap + NSE scripts	Port scanning + basic vulnerability detection
Qualys	Cloud-based vulnerability scanning
Rapid7 Nexpose	Enterprise vulnerability management solution
ðŸ”¹ 4. Patch Management Basics

Patch Management: Updating systems with latest security patches to fix vulnerabilities

Critical to reduce attack surface

Steps:

Identify missing patches

Test patches in lab

Deploy patches to production

Verify installation

ðŸ”¹ 5. Practical Tasks
Task A: Install OpenVAS (Kali Linux)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openvas -y
sudo gvm-setup
sudo gvm-check-setup


ðŸ“¸ Screenshot â†’ Day21_VA/openvas_setup.png

Task B: Run a Vulnerability Scan

Open OpenVAS â†’ Start a new scan

Target = Test VM or IP in lab

View scan results â†’ Export report

Task C: Nmap + NSE Vulnerability Scan
nmap -sV --script vuln 192.168.1.10


Checks for known vulnerabilities on open ports

Task D: Patch Verification (Windows/Linux)

Windows:

Get-HotFix


Linux (Ubuntu):

sudo apt update && apt list --upgradable


Apply pending patches

Task E: Create Vulnerability Report

Save as Markdown or CSV:

# Vulnerability Assessment Report

- Asset: Windows 10 VM  
- Vulnerabilities Found: 5  
- Critical: 1, High: 2, Medium: 2  
- Action Taken: Patched critical vulnerability, monitored others
