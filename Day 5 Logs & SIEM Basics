Day 5 â€“ Logs & SIEM Basics (Splunk / Wazuh)
ðŸ”¹ 1. What are Logs?

Logs are records of events happening in a system, network, or application.

They help analysts track user activity, detect security incidents, and troubleshoot issues.

Types of logs:

System logs â€“ OS-related activity.

Application logs â€“ App errors, crashes, or updates.

Security logs â€“ Authentication attempts, access control, privileges.

Network logs â€“ Firewall, IDS/IPS traffic logs.

ðŸ”¹ 2. What is SIEM?

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a solution that:

Collects logs from multiple sources.

Correlates and analyzes them.

Generates alerts for suspicious activity.

Examples: Splunk, Wazuh, ELK Stack, IBM QRadar.

ðŸ”¹ 3. SIEM Workflow

Log Collection â€“ Gather logs from endpoints, servers, firewalls.

Normalization â€“ Convert logs into standard format.

Correlation â€“ Match patterns across logs to detect threats.

Alerting â€“ Trigger alerts for suspicious behavior.

Reporting & Dashboards â€“ Summarize incidents for SOC teams.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Practical Task (Using Splunk Free or Wazuh)
Option 1: Splunk (Free)

Download and install Splunk Free (Linux/Windows).

Add sample logs (Windows logs or Apache web logs).

Run a simple query in Splunk Search:

index=* sourcetype=wineventlog:security EventCode=4625


â†’ Show failed login attempts.

Create a simple dashboard showing login success vs failure.

ðŸ“¸ Save screenshots:

Splunk Search results â†’ Day5_SIEM/splunk_failed_logins.png

Dashboard view â†’ Day5_SIEM/splunk_dashboard.png

Option 2: Wazuh (Open Source SIEM)

Install Wazuh (cloud or VM).

Add a monitored endpoint (Windows/Linux).

Generate test logs by failed login attempts.

View alerts in Wazuh dashboard.

ðŸ“¸ Save screenshots:

Wazuh alert for failed logon â†’ Day5_SIEM/wazuh_failed_login.png

ðŸ”¹ 5. Key Commands (Linux for Log Checking)

cat /var/log/auth.log â†’ Check authentication logs.

cat /var/log/syslog â†’ Check system logs.

tail -f /var/log/auth.log â†’ Live log monitoring.
