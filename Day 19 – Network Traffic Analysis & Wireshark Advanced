Day 19 â€“ Network Traffic Analysis & Wireshark Advanced
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)?

Network Traffic Analysis = Monitoring and inspecting network traffic to detect anomalies, threats, or malicious activity.

Goals:

Identify suspicious connections

Detect malware communication

Troubleshoot network issues

ðŸ”¹ 2. Wireshark Basics

Wireshark = Open-source packet capture tool for analyzing network traffic.

Key Features:

Capture live packets

Apply filters

Inspect protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS, etc.)

Follow streams (TCP/HTTP)

ðŸ”¹ 3. Common Network Protocols
Protocol	Port	Description
TCP	0-65535	Reliable connection-oriented
UDP	0-65535	Connectionless, fast
ICMP	N/A	Ping, traceroute
HTTP	80	Web traffic
HTTPS	443	Secure web traffic
DNS	53	Domain resolution
SSH	22	Secure shell
FTP	21/20	File transfer
SMTP	25	Mail transfer
ðŸ”¹ 4. Advanced Wireshark Filters

Capture Filter: Filters traffic during capture

Example: tcp port 80 â†’ Capture only HTTP traffic

Display Filter: Filters traffic after capture

Example: ip.src == 192.168.1.10 && tcp.port == 443

Follow Stream: Right-click packet â†’ Follow â†’ TCP/HTTP Stream

Statistics: Analyze traffic trends, top talkers, protocol distribution

ðŸ”¹ 5. Practical Tasks
Task A: Capture Basic Traffic

Open Wireshark â†’ select interface â†’ Start capture

Open browser â†’ visit http://example.com

Stop capture â†’ Apply filter: http

Task B: Inspect TCP 3-Way Handshake

Filter: tcp

Identify SYN â†’ SYN/ACK â†’ ACK packets

Task C: Analyze DNS Requests

Filter: dns

Visit multiple websites

Check resolved IP addresses and queries

Task D: Follow HTTP Stream

Right-click HTTP GET request â†’ Follow â†’ HTTP Stream

View request/response contents

Task E: Detect Suspicious Traffic

Filter unusual ports or external IPs:

ip.dst != 192.168.1.0/24


Identify unknown external connections for further analysis
