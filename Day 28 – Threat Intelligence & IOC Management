Day 28 â€“ Threat Intelligence & IOC Management
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Threat Intelligence?

Threat Intelligence (TI) = Process of collecting, analyzing, and sharing data about malicious activities (IOCs, TTPs, threat actors).

Goal:

Anticipate attacks

Improve detection (SIEM, EDR)

Reduce false positives

ðŸ”¹ 2. Types of Threat Intelligence
Type	Example	Purpose
Strategic	Threat actor reports	High-level business decisions
Tactical	MITRE ATT&CK techniques	Understand attack behavior
Operational	Campaign reports, malware families	Defend against specific attacks
Technical	IOCs (IPs, hashes, domains)	Feed into SIEM/EDR for detection
ðŸ”¹ 3. IOC (Indicators of Compromise)

Examples of IOCs:

File Hashes â†’ MD5, SHA1, SHA256

Domains/URLs â†’ malicious.com, update.fake.net

IP Addresses â†’ 192.168.1.50 connecting to external C2

Registry Keys â†’ Persistence mechanisms

ðŸ”¹ 4. Threat Intel Platforms
Tool	Purpose
MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)	IOC sharing, threat feeds
OpenCTI	Threat actor & campaign intelligence
VirusTotal / Hybrid Analysis	IOC collection
AlienVault OTX	Community threat intel feeds
MITRE ATT&CK	Mapping adversary techniques
ðŸ”¹ 5. Practical Tasks
Task A: IOC Collection

Collect IOCs from VirusTotal (file hash, domains, IPs).

Save as JSON or CSV.
ðŸ“„ Save file â†’ Day28_TI/ioc_list.csv

Task B: MISP Integration

Install MISP (or use online demo).

Import IOC list into MISP.

Create an event with malware family and related indicators.

Task C: IOC Use in SIEM

Import IOC list into Splunk/ELK.

Example SPL (check logs against IOCs):

index=security [| inputlookup ioc_list.csv | fields ip]

Task D: Threat Intel Report
# Threat Intel Report â€“ 2025-09-10

- Source: VirusTotal, MISP
- IOCs Collected: 5 IPs, 3 Domains, 2 File Hashes
- Usage: Imported into SIEM for alerting
- Benefit: Improved detection of malware callbacks
