Day 10 â€“ SIEM Use Cases & Alert Tuning
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is a SIEM Use Case?

A SIEM use case = A security scenario we want to detect using logs.

Example:

Multiple failed logins from same IP â†’ Brute Force Attack.

Traffic to blacklisted IP â†’ C2 Communication.

Large data transfer outside network â†’ Data Exfiltration.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Common SOC Use Cases
Use Case	Log Source	Detection Logic
Brute Force Login	Windows/Linux logs	10 failed logins in 5 mins
Privilege Escalation	Windows Security logs	User added to Administrators group
Malware Communication	Proxy/Firewall	Traffic to known malicious IP/domain
Suspicious File Execution	Endpoint logs	File executed from %TEMP% folder
Data Exfiltration	Firewall/DLP	Large outbound transfer on unusual port
ðŸ”¹ 3. What is Alert Tuning?

Alert Tuning = Optimizing SIEM alerts to reduce false positives.

Example:

If every login attempt creates an alert â†’ too noisy.

Instead, tune to alert only if login attempts > 10 in 5 mins.

Goal = Accurate alerts that SOC Analysts can act on.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Practical Task
Task A: Splunk Query for Brute Force Detection
index=security sourcetype=wineventlog:security EventCode=4625
| stats count by src_ip, user
| where count > 5


Detects failed logins (EventCode 4625) with more than 5 attempts.

Task B: Wazuh Use Case

Install Wazuh agent on a Linux machine.

Generate failed SSH logins:

ssh wronguser@localhost


Check Wazuh â†’ Alerts triggered.

Task C: ELK Query (Kibana)
event.code: "4625" AND host.name: "windows-server"


Detects failed logins in Kibana.

ðŸ”¹ 5. SOC Workflow for Alert Handling

Alert Triggered â†’ SIEM raises event.

Triage â†’ Analyst checks severity, user, source.

Investigate â†’ Look at related logs (firewall, proxy, endpoint).

Respond â†’ Block IP, disable account, escalate incident.

Tune â†’ If false positive, refine rules.
