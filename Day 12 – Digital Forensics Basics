Day 12 â€“ Digital Forensics Basics (Windows + Linux Artifacts)
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Digital Forensics?

Digital Forensics = Process of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence.

Goal:

Investigate cyber incidents.

Collect evidence for legal/compliance.

Understand attacker behavior.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Digital Forensics Process

Identification â†’ Find where evidence exists (logs, memory, files).

Preservation â†’ Protect data from tampering.

Collection â†’ Extract artifacts safely.

Examination & Analysis â†’ Study evidence.

Presentation â†’ Report findings.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Windows Forensics (Key Artifacts)

Event Logs (Security, System, Application)

Location: C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs

Registry Keys

User logins, startup programs, USB history.

Prefetch Files

Stores executed programs â†’ C:\Windows\Prefetch

Recycle Bin

Deleted files.

Memory Dump (RAM)

Running processes, credentials.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Linux Forensics (Key Artifacts)

/var/log/auth.log â†’ Authentication attempts.

/var/log/syslog â†’ System events.

~/.bash_history â†’ User commands.

/etc/passwd & /etc/shadow â†’ Users & password hashes.

Network Connections

netstat -tulnp
ss -tulnp
lsof -i

ðŸ”¹ 5. Forensic Tools

Windows: FTK Imager, Autopsy, Volatility (memory analysis), RegRipper.

Linux: Sleuth Kit, Autopsy, grep/log analysis.

Cross-Platform: Wireshark, Hashcalc, CyberChef.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Practical Tasks
Task A: Windows Event Log Analysis

Open Event Viewer â†’ Security Logs.

Search Event ID:

4624 = Successful login

4625 = Failed login

Export log as .evtx.

Task B: Linux Log Analysis

Show recent logins:

last


Show failed login attempts:

grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log


Show bash history:

cat ~/.bash_history



Task C: File Integrity Check (Both OS)

Generate hash of a file:

sha256sum important.txt


Modify file.

Generate hash again â†’ Compare difference.
