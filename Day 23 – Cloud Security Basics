Day 23 â€“ Cloud Security Basics
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Cloud Security?

Cloud Security = Protecting cloud-based infrastructure, applications, and data.

Purpose:

Prevent unauthorized access

Protect data in transit and at rest

Ensure compliance and monitoring

ðŸ”¹ 2. Key Cloud Service Providers
Cloud	Key Security Features
AWS (Amazon Web Services)	Security Groups, IAM, CloudTrail, VPC
Azure	NSG (Network Security Groups), Azure AD, Monitor, Defender
GCP (Google Cloud Platform)	IAM, VPC Firewall, Security Command Center
ðŸ”¹ 3. Core Cloud Security Concepts
ðŸ”¸ IAM (Identity & Access Management)

Control who can access resources

Principle of Least Privilege â†’ Users get only required access

Examples: AWS IAM Users, Groups, Roles

ðŸ”¸ Security Groups / Firewalls

Acts like virtual firewall

Control inbound & outbound traffic by IP, port, protocol

ðŸ”¸ Cloud Monitoring & Logging

AWS CloudTrail / Azure Monitor / GCP Logging

Logs all API calls, configuration changes, and user activity

ðŸ”¸ Data Encryption

At rest: EBS volumes, S3 buckets

In transit: TLS/HTTPS

ðŸ”¹ 4. Practical Tasks
Task A: AWS Free Tier Setup

Create AWS Free Tier account

Launch EC2 instance (Linux)

Assign Security Group â†’ Allow SSH (22) and HTTP (80) only

Task B: IAM User Creation

Go to AWS IAM â†’ Users â†’ Add User

Assign Programmatic Access + Console Access

Attach ReadOnlyAccess policy

Task C: Security Group Rules

Edit inbound rules â†’ Add/remove ports

Test connection using SSH or HTTP

Try to connect from blocked IP â†’ Should fail

Task D: CloudTrail Logging

Enable CloudTrail on AWS

Check logs â†’ Events like login, API calls, config changes

Task E: Test Encryption

Create S3 bucket â†’ Enable Server-Side Encryption (AES-256)

Upload a test file â†’ Verify encryption
