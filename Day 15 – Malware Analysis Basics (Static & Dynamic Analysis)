Day 15 – Malware Analysis Basics (Static & Dynamic Analysis)
🔹 1. What is Malware Analysis?

Malware Analysis = Study of malicious software to understand its behavior, impact, and mitigation.

Purpose:

Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

Detect persistence mechanisms.

Develop signatures for IDS/IPS/SIEM.

Support Incident Response.

🔹 2. Types of Malware Analysis
🔸 Static Analysis (Without Execution)

Inspecting malware file without running it.

Techniques:

File metadata (hashes, size, type).

Strings analysis (strings malware.exe).

Checking imports/exports (PE files in Windows).

Using tools like PEStudio, ExifTool, BinText.

🔸 Dynamic Analysis (Execution in Sandbox)

Running malware in a controlled environment.

Observe behavior:

Processes created.

Files dropped.

Registry modifications.

Network connections.

Tools: Cuckoo Sandbox, Any.Run, Process Monitor, Wireshark.

🔹 3. Key Tools for Malware Analysis

Static:

strings, file, md5sum, sha256sum

PEStudio, Detect It Easy (DIE)

Dynamic:

Cuckoo Sandbox (Linux).

Process Monitor (Windows).

Wireshark (network traffic).

🔹 4. Practical Tasks

⚠️ Safety Note: Never run real malware on your host machine. Use Kali VM / Windows VM in isolated mode.

Task A: File Hashing (Static Analysis)
md5sum sample.exe
sha256sum sample.exe
file sample.exe
strings sample.exe | head -n 20



Task B: Windows Static Analysis with PEStudio

Install PEStudio on a Windows VM.

Open sample .exe.

Observe imports/exports (e.g., suspicious API calls like CreateRemoteThread, LoadLibrary).

Task C: Dynamic Analysis with Process Monitor

Open Process Monitor (ProcMon).

Run malware sample inside isolated VM.

Observe:

Files created.

Registry changes.

Processes spawned.

Task D: Dynamic Analysis with Wireshark

Start Wireshark capture.

Run malware sample.

Observe:

DNS requests (C2 servers).

HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

Possible exfiltration attempts.

🔹 5. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

File Hashes: MD5/SHA256 of malware sample.

Registry Keys: Persistence mechanisms.

Processes: Unusual process trees.

Network: Suspicious IPs/domains.

🔹 6. Key Takeaways
