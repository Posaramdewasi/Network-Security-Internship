Day 25 â€“ Incident Response Process & Playbooks
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Incident Response (IR)?

Incident Response (IR) = Process of identifying, investigating, containing, and mitigating security incidents.

Purpose:

Minimize damage

Restore normal operations

Collect evidence for analysis

ðŸ”¹ 2. Incident Response Phases (NIST Framework)
Phase	Description
Preparation	Policies, playbooks, training, tools ready
Identification	Detect incidents (alerts from SIEM, firewall, EDR)
Containment	Short-term & long-term steps to limit damage
Eradication	Remove root cause (malware, vulnerable accounts)
Recovery	Restore systems to normal operations
Lessons Learned	Post-incident analysis to prevent recurrence
ðŸ”¹ 3. SOC Playbooks

Playbook = Predefined steps SOC Analysts follow for specific incidents.

Examples:

Phishing Email Alert

Quarantine email â†’ Check URLs & attachments â†’ Block sender â†’ Notify user â†’ Document

Malware Detection on Endpoint

Isolate machine â†’ Run antivirus / EDR scan â†’ Collect logs â†’ Remediate â†’ Restore

Unauthorized Login Attempt

Verify IP â†’ Lock account if malicious â†’ Reset password â†’ Alert SOC team

ðŸ”¹ 4. Practical Tasks
Task A: Create Incident Response Playbook (Phishing)

Use Markdown:

# Phishing Email Incident Playbook

1. Quarantine suspicious email
2. Analyze attachments & links
3. Check IOC against Threat Intel
4. Block sender/domain
5. Notify affected users
6. Document incident in SIEM ticket

Task B: Simulate Malware IR on Endpoint

Use Windows VM â†’ Run test malware in isolated lab

Contain: Disconnect network

Eradicate: Run antivirus + Sysmon logs

Recover: Re-enable network, verify system

Task C: Handle Unauthorized Login Incident

Generate multiple failed login attempts â†’ Check SIEM alerts

Lock user account

Investigate source IP â†’ Block if malicious

Task D: Document IR Incident

Create a simple incident report:

# Incident Report â€“ Malware Infection

- Date/Time: 2025-09-09 10:30
- Type: Malware
- Affected Endpoint: Windows 10 VM
- Action Taken: Isolated endpoint, cleaned malware, restored system
- Lessons Learned: Monitor Sysmon logs for suspicious processes
