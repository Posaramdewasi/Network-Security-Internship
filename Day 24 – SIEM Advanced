Day 24 â€“ SIEM Advanced (Correlation Rules, Alerts, Dashboards)
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Advanced SIEM?

Advanced SIEM = Using SIEM not just for log collection, but for proactive threat detection using correlation, alerts, and dashboards.

Purpose:

Detect complex attacks

Reduce false positives

Visualize security posture

ðŸ”¹ 2. Correlation Rules

Correlation Rule = Combines multiple log events to identify suspicious activity.

Example:

10 failed logins (Event ID 4625) + 1 successful login from same IP â†’ Alert for brute force

Splunk Example SPL:

index=security EventCode=4625 OR EventCode=4624
| stats count by src_ip, user
| where count > 5


ELK Example (Kibana + Elastic Rule):

Create threshold-based detection â†’ Trigger alert when >5 failed logins in 10 min

ðŸ”¹ 3. Alerts in SIEM

Alerts = Notifications sent when suspicious behavior detected

Types:

Email â†’ Notify SOC analyst

Dashboard / Widget Highlight â†’ Show top threats

Webhook / API â†’ Trigger automated response

Best Practice: Configure alert thresholds to reduce false positives

ðŸ”¹ 4. Dashboards

Dashboards = Visual representation of security events

Examples:

Top failed logins by IP/user

Blocked firewall connections

Top processes per endpoint (Sysmon)

Web traffic anomalies (HTTP, DNS)

Splunk: Dashboard Panel â†’ Add Visualization

Kibana: Lens / Visualize â†’ Charts / Tables / Graphs

ðŸ”¹ 5. Practical Tasks
Task A: Create Correlation Rule in Splunk

Open Splunk â†’ Search â†’ Use SPL for failed + successful logins

Save as Alert â†’ Trigger on threshold > 5 failed logins

Task B: Create Dashboard in Splunk

Search for top blocked IPs from firewall logs

index=firewall action=blocked | stats count by src_ip


Save as Dashboard Panel

Task C: Create Threshold Alert in Kibana (ELK)

Go to Stack Management â†’ Rules

Create Threshold rule â†’ >5 failed logins in 10 min

Test alert by generating failed logins in lab

Task D: Visualize Security Events in Kibana

Use Lens to plot:

Failed logins by IP

Suspicious processes

Web traffic anomalies
